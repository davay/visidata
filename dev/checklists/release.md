    c. visidata.org; (formats?)
        - remember to check the tables with prettier: https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/pull/2056

3. Ensure `develop` automated tests run correctly with dev/test.sh

   c. update version number on README

   d. bump version in `__version__` in source code (visidata/main.py, visidata/__init__.py) and setup.py;

6. Run dev/mkman.sh to build the manpage and updated website

9. Push code to stable

10. Push `stable` to pypi

    a. set up a ~/.pypirc

    twine upload dist/*
    ```

11. Test install/upgrade from pypi

  a. Build and deploy the website

   b. Ask someone else to test install

12. Create a tag `v#.#.#` for that commit

```

# conda

Registry: https://github.com/conda-forge/visidata-feedstock/

1. Fork https://github.com/conda-forge/visidata-feedstock. Open the recipe/meta.yaml.

4. Make a PR.

5. Comment `@conda-forge-admin, please rerender` in the PR.

6. Merge the PR, when everything is green.


# Homebrew

Registry: https://github.com/saulpw/homebrew-vd

1. Open the Formula/visidata.rb file. Update the link in url to the new visidata tar.gz file.
2. Update the sha256 and version in visidata.rb. Update the version in README.md.
3. For major version ships, check each dependency and see if it has been updated. If so, update the url and sha256 for the newest version.
4. On a mac, test the formula with `brew install --build-from-source visidata`. Fix as needed.
5. Audit the formula with `brew audit --new-formula visidata`
6. Add and commit the formula.

## Debian
1. Download the visidata tar.gz file from pypi
2. tar -xzmf visidata.tar.gz
3. cp visidata.ver.tar.gz visidata_ver.orig.tar.gz
4. cd visidata-ver/
5. Place there the contents of the debian directory from git@salsa.debian.org:anjakefala/visidata.git
6. Update changelog
```
dch -v new_version
```

where new_version = "$version"-1

Edit as necessary. I usually set stability to unstable, and urgency to low, and add a small changelog.
7. Run debuild. Fix errors as they come up.
8. If a package fails to import a module, it must be added to the build dependencies as python3-modules
9. cd ..
10. If unsigned by debuild, sign the changes files
```
debsign -k keycode visidata_ver.changes
```

anjakefala has the key and password.
11. Upload to debian mentors and contact the mentor, [Martin](https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?email=debacle%40debian.org).
```
dput mentors visidata_ver.changes
```

12. Copy the fresh contents of the debian folder back into visidata/dev/debian and in debian-visidata (https://salsa.debian.org/anjakefala/visidata).

## deb-vd
Private registry: https://github.com/saulpw/deb-vd
1. Enter saulpw/deb-vd.
